<h1> My Attaché Case </h1>

<h2> HOME </h2>
<p> Hi, I'm Jove!</p>
<p> I'm currently studying web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while bringing years of professional experience in operations, 
  technical machinery, and customer service. With a strong foundation in problem-solving, quality assurance, and team leadership, 
  I'm now shifting my focus to building user-friendly, responsive websites.</p>

<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
<p> With a diverse background in manufacturing, customer service, and team management, I've always been drawn to structure, precision, and efficiency — qualities that naturally led me to web development.
Currently enrolled in ICT training at Yoobee Colleges NZ (Level 6 Certificate in IT), I'm focused on learning the technologies behind modern websites — including HTML5, CSS3, JS and C++.
 I'm excited to grow into a front-end or full-stack developer role and bring a unique perspective shaped by hands-on experience across industries.</p>
